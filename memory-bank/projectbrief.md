# Document Template Management System

## Project Overview
A robust document template management system that enables users to store, retrieve, and process document templates with dynamic variable replacement. The system integrates with a chat interface (like Slack) for document generation based on user input.

## Core Requirements

### Template Management
- [ ] Store and manage document templates (e.g., DOCX, MD, TXT)
- [ ] Extract and validate template variables (e.g., `{{variable_name}}`)
- [ ] Support template metadata (name, description, variables)
- [ ] CRUD operations for templates
- [ ] Secure file storage and retrieval

### Template Processing
- [ ] Dynamic variable replacement in templates
- [ ] Support for various document structures (text, potentially tables/paragraphs depending on format)
- [ ] Template validation before processing
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] Generate and provide output document (original format or PDF)

### Chat Integration (e.g., Slack)
- [ ] Commands to list templates (`/docgen list templates`)
- [ ] Command to initiate document generation (`/docgen create <template_name>`)
- [ ] Interactive prompting for variable values via chat
- [ ] Deliver generated document via chat (link or file)

### Security
- [ ] Secure file handling (storage, access)
- [ ] Input validation (chat inputs, API calls)
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] User authentication and authorization (Future Phase)
- [ ] Rate limiting (Future Phase)
- [ ] Audit logging (Future Phase)

## Success Criteria
1.  Templates can be uploaded, stored, and retrieved reliably.
2.  Variables are correctly extracted from templates.
3.  Documents are generated accurately with user-provided data via chat.
4.  Chat interface provides a clear and efficient workflow for document generation.
5.  System maintains data integrity and security for templates and generated documents.
6.  Initial implementation focuses on core functionality; performance optimization later.

## Constraints
- Initial focus on specific template formats (e.g., DOCX, MD, TXT), decided during implementation.
- Secure storage requirements.
- Chat platform limitations (e.g., Slack API capabilities).
- Resource constraints for template processing.

## Timeline (Revised)
Phase 1 (Current Focus):
- Setup core project structure (FastAPI, Database).
- Implement basic template management (Upload, List, Store, Variable Extraction).
- Implement basic document generation logic (variable replacement).
- Setup initial Chat integration framework (e.g., Slack bot connection).

Phase 2 (Next Steps):
- Implement chat commands for listing templates and initiating generation.
- Implement interactive variable prompting via chat.
- Refine document generation and delivery via chat.
- Basic security measures (input validation, secure storage).

Phase 3 (Future):
- Support for more template formats or complex structures.
- User authentication/authorization.
- Advanced features (versioning, search improvements).
- Audit logging, rate limiting.
- Deployment and monitoring.
