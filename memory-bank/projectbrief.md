# Document Template Management with RAG

## Project Overview
A document processing system that enables users to upload documents via a web interface, analyze them using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and suggest appropriate document templates from a template library. The system provides two main API endpoints - /file for document upload and /chat for interacting with the uploaded documents.

## Core Requirements

### Document Processing
- [ ] Process uploaded documents (e.g., DOCX, PDF, TXT)
- [ ] Store documents in Supabase vector store
- [ ] Maintain a library of document templates
- [ ] Analyze uploaded documents and suggest appropriate templates
- [ ] Secure file storage and retrieval

### Template Management
- [ ] Store document templates in the /templates directory
- [ ] Support template metadata (name, description, purpose)
- [ ] Select appropriate templates based on document analysis
- [ ] Support various document formats (DOCX, MD, TXT)

### API Endpoints
- [ ] `/file` endpoint for document upload and processing
- [ ] `/chat` endpoint for interacting with processed documents
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] Secure API access

### RAG Integration
- [ ] Integration with Supabase for vector storage
- [ ] Document chunking and embedding
- [ ] Retrieval of relevant document sections
- [ ] Document analysis

### Security
- [ ] Secure file handling (storage, access)
- [ ] Input validation (API calls)
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] User authentication and authorization (Future Phase)
- [ ] Rate limiting (Future Phase)
- [ ] Audit logging (Future Phase)

## Success Criteria
1. Documents can be uploaded, processed, and stored in Supabase reliably.
2. The system can analyze documents and suggest appropriate templates.
3. The API endpoints are secure and robust.
4. The system maintains data integrity and security for documents and templates.
5. Initial implementation focuses on core functionality; performance optimization later.

## Constraints
- Focus on specific document formats (e.g., DOCX, PDF, TXT).
- Secure storage requirements.
- Integration with Supabase.
- Resource constraints for document processing.

## Timeline (Revised)
Phase 1 (Current Focus):
- Setup core project structure (FastAPI, Supabase).
- Implement /file endpoint for document upload and processing.
- Implement document chunking and embedding for Supabase.
- Setup template directory structure.

Phase 2 (Next Steps):
- Implement /chat endpoint for interacting with documents.
- Implement document analysis to suggest templates.
- Refine document processing and storage.
- Basic security measures (input validation, secure storage).

Phase 3 (Future):
- Support for more document formats or complex structures.
- User authentication/authorization.
- Advanced features (versioning, search improvements).
- Audit logging, rate limiting.
- Deployment and monitoring.
