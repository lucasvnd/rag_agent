# Document Template Management System

## Project Overview
A robust document template management system that enables users to store, retrieve, and process document templates with dynamic variable replacement. The system integrates with a chat interface for intelligent document processing and supports DOCX file formats.

## Core Requirements

### Template Management
- [x] Store and manage document templates (DOCX format)
- [x] Extract and validate template variables
- [x] Support template metadata and versioning
- [x] CRUD operations for templates
- [x] Secure file storage and retrieval

### Template Processing
- [x] Dynamic variable replacement in templates
- [x] Support for complex document structures (tables, paragraphs)
- [x] Template validation before processing
- [x] Error handling and validation
- [x] Processed document storage

### Chat Integration
- [x] Natural language processing for template queries
- [x] Context-aware document generation
- [x] Intelligent variable extraction from user input
- [x] Integration with vector store for relevant context

### Security
- [x] Secure file handling
- [x] Input validation
- [x] Error handling
- [ ] User authentication and authorization
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Audit logging

## Success Criteria
1. Templates can be uploaded, stored, and retrieved reliably
2. Variables are correctly extracted and validated
3. Documents are processed accurately with provided data
4. Chat interface provides accurate and helpful responses
5. System maintains data integrity and security
6. Performance meets production requirements

## Constraints
- DOCX format only for templates
- Secure storage requirements for sensitive documents
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Resource constraints for template processing
- Compliance with data protection regulations
