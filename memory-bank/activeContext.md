# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Validating core template management functionality
- Setting up test environments and fixtures

## Recent Changes
1. Testing Infrastructure
   - Created detailed test plan (`tests/test_plan.md`)
   - Implemented model tests (`tests/test_models.py`)
   - Set up test fixtures (`tests/conftest.py`)
   - Added mock database and file storage for testing

2. Test Coverage
   - Template model validation
   - Template creation and update flows
   - Basic repository operations
   - File handling utilities

3. Test Environment
   - SQLite test database configuration
   - Temporary file handling
   - Mock services and utilities
   - Async test support

## Active Decisions

### Testing Strategy
1. Bottom-up Testing Approach
   - Start with model validation
   - Move to repository operations
   - Then service layer testing
   - Finally API integration tests

2. Test Data Management
   - Using temporary directories for files
   - Mock database for unit tests
   - Fixtures for common test data
   - Cleanup procedures

3. Async Testing
   - Using pytest-asyncio
   - Async database sessions
   - Mock async operations
   - Event loop management

### Current Considerations
1. Test Coverage
   - Need to implement repository tests
   - Service layer tests pending
   - API integration tests to be added
   - Performance testing infrastructure needed

2. Test Data
   - Need sample templates
   - Mock data for various scenarios
   - Edge case test data
   - Performance test data sets

3. Test Environment
   - Local vs CI environment setup
   - Database seeding strategies
   - File storage management
   - Environment variable handling

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. [ ] Create test data directory with base templates
2. [ ] Implement repository tests
3. [ ] Add service layer tests
4. [ ] Set up API integration tests

### Short-term Goals
1. [ ] Complete unit test suite
2. [ ] Set up CI pipeline
3. [ ] Add performance tests
4. [ ] Implement security tests

### Documentation Needs
1. [ ] Test coverage reporting
2. [ ] Test execution guide
3. [ ] CI/CD documentation
4. [ ] Test data management guide

## Open Questions
1. Performance testing thresholds
2. Security test coverage requirements
3. Integration test scope
4. Production deployment testing strategy
