# Project Progress

## What Works

### Foundational Setup
1.  **Project Structure:** Basic FastAPI project layout established.
2.  **Version Control:** Git repository setup on GitHub with proper commit history.
3.  **Memory Bank:** All core memory bank files updated to reflect the Document Processing with RAG and Template Suggestion focus.
4.  **Containerization:** Basic Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` exist.
5.  **Template Examples:** Sample templates stored in the `/templates` directory.
6.  **Database Schema:** Initial migration created for Supabase integration with document processing focus.
7.  **Testing Infrastructure:** Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and API tests using pytest.
8.  **Continuous Integration:** GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing.

## Current Status (Phase 1 In Progress)

### Core Application Setup
1.  **FastAPI Application:** Initialized the main app instance with `/file` and `/chat` endpoints.
2.  **Environment Configuration:** Updated `.env` and `.env.example` files for Supabase integration.
3.  **Database Schema:** Created SQL migration for document chunks and template metadata tables.
4.  **Project Scope:** Clarified and aligned all documentation with the correct RAG-based document processing focus.
5.  **Code Cleanup:** Removed unused files and components not related to our project scope.
6.  **Testing Framework:** Implemented test fixtures, mocks, and test cases for all core functionality.

### Testing Infrastructure
1.  **Test Organization:** Structured tests into unit, integration, and API categories.
2.  **Test Fixtures:** Created reusable fixtures for document samples, Supabase mocks, and embeddings.
3.  **Mocking Strategy:** Implemented mocks for external services like Supabase and OpenAI.
4.  **Document Processing Tests:** Created tests for PDF, DOCX, and TXT processing and chunking.
5.  **API Endpoint Tests:** Implemented tests for `/file` and `/chat` endpoints.
6.  **Integration Tests:** Created tests for Supabase vector database interactions.
7.  **CI Pipeline:** Set up GitHub Actions workflow for test automation with coverage reporting.
8.  **Testing Documentation:** Created TESTING_STRATEGY.md with comprehensive guidelines.

### Version Control Workflow
1.  **Repository:** GitHub repository at `lucasvnd/rag_agent` manages project code.
2.  **Branch Strategy:** 
    * Protected `main` branch that requires pull request reviews before merging
    * Feature branches for all new development (`feature/feature-name`)
    * Bugfix branches for fixes (`fix/issue-description`)
    * Release branches when preparing releases (`release/vX.Y.Z`)
3.  **Commit Strategy:**
    * Small, frequent commits that represent atomic changes
    * Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): message` (e.g., `feat(api): add file upload endpoint`)
    * Commit types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
    * Each commit should leave the codebase in a working state
4.  **Pull Request Process:**
    * Descriptive PR titles and descriptions
    * Link PRs to issues when applicable
    * Code review required before merging
    * Squash and merge option for cleaner history
5.  **Recent Commits:**
    * Update `productContext.md` to align with RAG-based document processing
    * Update project to focus on document processing with RAG and template suggestions
    * Clean: Remove unused files and RAG-specific code
    * Refactor: Align memory bank with Document Template Management System scope

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
1.  **Implementation to Pass Tests:**
    *   Develop document processor services.
    *   Implement API endpoints following test specifications.
    *   Create Supabase repository layer with vector search.
2.  **Supabase Integration:**
    *   Implement connection to Supabase vector database.
    *   Create repository/service layer for document storage.
    *   Set up document chunking and embedding logic.
2.  **API Implementation:**
    *   Implement `/file` endpoint for document upload and processing.
    *   Build document processing pipeline (extract, chunk, embed, store).
    *   Add basic error handling and validation.
3.  **Template Management:**
    *   Create catalog of existing templates in `/templates` directory.
    *   Implement metadata extraction for templates.
    *   Set up template suggestion logic.
4.  **Initial Testing:** 
    *   Unit tests for document processing.
    *   Integration tests for API endpoints.
    *   Test Supabase integration.

### Phase 2: Chat Interface & Template Suggestion
1.  **Chat API Implementation:**
    *   Implement `/chat` endpoint for document analysis.
    *   Create query processing and RAG retrieval logic.
    *   Build template suggestion algorithm.
2.  **Document Analysis:**
    *   Implement content analysis based on RAG.
    *   Create algorithm to match documents with appropriate templates.
    *   Store template suggestion history.
3.  **Template Utilization:**
    *   Implement logic to retrieve and process suggested templates.
    *   Build template adaptation based on document content.
4.  **Enhanced Error Handling:**
    *   Improve document processing error handling.
    *   Add better validation for different file types.
    *   Implement graceful failure modes.

### Phase 3: Refinements & Future Features
1.  **Advanced Search:** Improve RAG-based document search and analysis.
2.  **User Management:** Authentication/Authorization for API endpoints.
3.  **Security Hardening:** Rate limiting, input sanitization, dependency scanning.
4.  **Deployment:** Production-ready Docker Swarm configuration on VPS.
5.  **Scalability & Performance:** Optimization of embedding generation and vector search.
6.  **UI:** Potential simple web UI for document upload and chat interaction.
