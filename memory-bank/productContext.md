# Product Context (`productContext.md`)

This document outlines the "why" behind the Document Template Management System project, the problems it aims to solve, how it should function, and the desired user experience.

## 1. Project Purpose & Vision

The core purpose of this project is to create a system that allows users to manage document templates efficiently. The vision is to enable users to easily create, store, retrieve, and populate templates with dynamic data, streamlining document generation processes. This system will integrate with a chat interface (like Slack) to facilitate template selection and data input.

## 2. Problem Statement

Currently, generating standardized documents often involves manual copying, pasting, and replacing placeholder text, which is:
-   **Time-consuming:** Repetitive manual effort slows down workflows.
-   **Error-prone:** Manual data entry increases the risk of mistakes and inconsistencies.
-   **Difficult to manage:** Tracking and updating multiple template versions across different locations is challenging.
-   **Lacks integration:** Generating documents often requires switching between different applications.

This system aims to solve these problems by providing a centralized, automated, and integrated solution.

## 3. Core Functionality

The system should provide the following core capabilities:

-   **Template Management:**
    -   Upload/create new document templates (e.g., `.docx`, `.md`, text).
    -   Store templates securely.
    -   List and search available templates.
    -   Define and manage variables/placeholders within templates.
-   **Variable Extraction:**
    -   Automatically identify predefined variables (e.g., `{{variable_name}}`) within uploaded templates.
    -   Store the list of variables associated with each template.
-   **Document Generation:**
    -   Allow users to select a template.
    -   Prompt users (potentially via chat) for values corresponding to the template's variables.
    -   Populate the selected template with the provided values.
    -   Generate the final document in its original format (or potentially PDF).
-   **Chat Integration (e.g., Slack):**
    -   Users can interact with the system via chat commands.
    -   List available templates via chat.
    -   Initiate document generation by selecting a template via chat.
    -   The system prompts the user for variable values through the chat interface.
    -   Deliver the generated document back to the user via chat or a download link.

## 4. User Experience Goals

-   **Intuitive:** The process of managing templates and generating documents should be straightforward and require minimal training.
-   **Efficient:** Users should be able to generate documents significantly faster than manual methods.
-   **Seamless:** Integration with chat should feel natural and reduce context switching.
-   **Reliable:** The system should consistently generate accurate documents based on the provided templates and data.

## 5. High-Level Workflow (Chat Integration Example)

1.  **User (in Slack):** `/docgen list templates`
2.  **System (in Slack):** Displays a list of available templates.
3.  **User (in Slack):** `/docgen create "Meeting Minutes Template"`
4.  **System (in Slack):** "Okay, I see the template 'Meeting Minutes Template' requires the following details: `{{meeting_date}}`, `{{attendees}}`, `{{agenda_link}}`. Please provide the value for `meeting_date`."
5.  **User (in Slack):** "2024-07-26"
6.  **System (in Slack):** "Got it. Now, please provide the value for `attendees`."
7.  **User (in Slack):** "Alice, Bob, Charlie"
8.  **System (in Slack):** "Great. Lastly, the value for `agenda_link`?"
9.  **User (in Slack):** "https://example.com/agenda"
10. **System (in Slack):** "Thanks! Generating your document..." (Generates document) "...Here is your completed Meeting Minutes document: [link to document or attached file]"
