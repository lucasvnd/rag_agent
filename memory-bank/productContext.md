# Product Context

This document outlines the "why" behind the Document Processing with RAG project, the problems it aims to solve, how it should function, and the desired user experience.

## 1. Project Purpose & Vision

The core purpose of this project is to create a system that processes documents using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and suggests appropriate document templates. Users will be able to send documents through a web interface, which will call the /file endpoint, where it will store their documents in the Supabase vector store database. From there, users will ask the system to analyze the document and suggest document templates from the /templates folder.

## 2. Problem Statement

Currently, analyzing documents and finding appropriate templates involves manual effort which is:
-   **Time-consuming:** Reviewing documents to identify their type and purpose requires significant time.
-   **Error-prone:** Manual document analysis can miss important details or patterns.
-   **Difficult to standardize:** Identifying appropriate templates is often subjective and inconsistent.
-   **Lacks automation:** The process requires significant human intervention at multiple stages.

This system aims to solve these problems by providing an automated, AI-driven document analysis and template suggestion solution.

## 3. Core Functionality

The system should provide the following core capabilities:

-   **Document Processing:**
    -   Upload and process documents (e.g., `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.txt`).
    -   Process and chunk documents for vector storage.
    -   Store documents and their embeddings in Supabase.
    -   Provide secure document handling.

-   **Template Management:**
    -   Store document templates in the /templates directory.
    -   Catalog templates with metadata (name, description, purpose).
    -   Define template categories and use cases.
    -   Enable retrieval of appropriate templates based on document analysis.

-   **RAG Implementation:**
    -   Generate embeddings for document chunks.
    -   Store and index embeddings in Supabase vector database.
    -   Implement semantic search for document analysis.
    -   Match document content with appropriate templates.

-   **API Integration:**
    -   Provide a `/file` endpoint for document upload and processing.
    -   Implement a `/chat` endpoint for document analysis and template suggestion.
    -   Return appropriate response with template suggestions.

## 4. User Experience Goals

-   **Intuitive:** The document upload and processing should be straightforward and require minimal training.
-   **Efficient:** Users should be able to get template suggestions significantly faster than manual analysis.
-   **Accurate:** The system should suggest templates that genuinely match the document content and purpose.
-   **Reliable:** The system should consistently analyze documents and provide useful template suggestions.

## 5. High-Level Workflow

1.  **Document Upload:** User uploads a document through the web interface, which calls the `/file` API endpoint.
2.  **Document Processing:** System processes the document, chunks it, generates embeddings, and stores in Supabase.
3.  **Document Analysis:** User queries the system through the `/chat` endpoint to analyze the document.
4.  **Template Suggestion:** System retrieves relevant document chunks from Supabase, analyzes content, and suggests appropriate templates.
5.  **Template Utilization:** User receives template suggestions and can utilize the appropriate template for their needs.
